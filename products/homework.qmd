In this exercise, I will use data set called "cushny" in package "psychTools". It is a small data set, so the results might have bias. I want to use this data set to explore the effect of different medications on sleep hours compared to control group.

## Data import

```{r, warning=FALSE}
#install.packages("psychTools")
library(psychTools)
df <- psychTools::cushny
head(df)

```

## Data description

```{r}
str(df)
summary(df)
sum(is.na(df)) #no missing data
#mean
mean_ct <-mean(df$Control) 
mean_d1 <- mean(df$drug1)
#median of control group,drug1
median_ct <- median(df$Control)
median_d1 <- median(df$drug1)
#quartiles
quart_ct <- quantile(df$Control, probs = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75))
quart_d1 <- quantile(df$drug1, probs = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75))
#sample variance and sample standard deviation
var(df$Control)
sd(df$Control)
var(df$drug1)
sd(df$drug1)
#range
range(df$Control)
range(df$drug1)
#IQR
IQR(df$Control)
summary(df$Control)

```

## Plots

```{r}
# Histogram in base R
hist(df$Control, breaks =3,freq = FALSE,
    main = "Distribution of control group")
# We can add mean (red) and median (blue): abline draws a straight line from a to b
# (or vertical as here)
abline(v = mean_ct, col = "red") 
abline(v = median_ct, col = "blue")


#box plot
myseq <- as.character(c("control","drug1","drug2L", "drug2R","delta1", "delta2L","delta2R"))
boxplot(list(df$Control,df$drug1,df$drug2L,df$drug2R,df$delta1,df$delta2L,df$delta2R), ylab = "Hours of sleep",
        xlab = "group", names=myseq)

#another box plot
psych::error.bars(df[1:4],within=TRUE,ylab="Hours of sleep",xlab="Drug condition",
       main="95% confidence of within subject effects")
```

## T-distribution (exact CI)

```{r}

#SE of different groups, we know that the length of each group is 10,so df=9
n <- length(df$Control)
SE_ct <- sd(df$Control) / sqrt(10) 
SE_d1 <- sd(df$drug1) / sqrt(10) 



#t-distribution (exact CI)
str(df)

tQuantile <- qt(p = 0.975, df =  9)

#control group
lowerCI_mean_ct <- mean_ct - tQuantile * SE_ct

upperCI_mean_ct <- mean_ct + tQuantile * SE_ct

cbind(mean_ct, lowerCI_mean_ct, upperCI_mean_ct)

t.test(df$Control, data = df, var.equal = FALSE)


#drug1 group
lowerCI_mean_d1 <- mean_d1 - tQuantile * SE_d1

upperCI_mean_d1 <- mean_d1 + tQuantile * SE_d1

cbind(mean_d1, lowerCI_mean_d1, upperCI_mean_d1)
```

## CIs for difference in group means

```{r}
diff_mean_d1c <- mean_d1-mean_ct
var_diff_mean_d1c <- 
  (9 * var(df$drug1) + 9 * var(df$Control)) / 
  (9 + 9 - 2)
SE_diff_mean_d1c <- sqrt(var_diff_mean_d1c) * sqrt(1/9 + 1/9) 

tQuantile_diff <- qt(p = 0.975, df = 9 + 9 - 2)

lowerCI_diff_mean_d1c <- diff_mean_d1c - tQuantile_diff * SE_diff_mean_d1c
upperCI_diff_mean_d1c <- diff_mean_d1c + tQuantile_diff * SE_diff_mean_d1c
cbind(diff_mean_d1c, lowerCI_diff_mean_d1c, upperCI_diff_mean_d1c)
#The mean drug1 group sleep 0.75 hour than control group. 
#We are 95% confident that the true difference in the drug group lies between-1.31 hour and 2.81 hour.


```

## A two group t-test

```{r}
#H0:the difference in the control group and drug1 group is zero
t.test(df$Control, df$drug1, data = df, var.equal = FALSE)
t.test(df$Control, df$drug1, data = df, var.equal = TRUE)
#p=0.4007>0.05, acceptH0, which shows there is no significant difference between the control group and drug1 group.

#H0:the difference in the control group and drug2L group is zero
t.test(df$Control,df$drug2L, data = df, var.equal = FALSE)
t.test(df$Control,df$drug2L, data = df, var.equal = TRUE)
#p=0.0072647<0.05, rejuectH0, which shows there is significant difference between the control group and drug2L group.

#H0:the difference in the control group and drug2R group is zero
t.test(df$Control,df$drug2R, data = df, var.equal = FALSE)
t.test(df$Control,df$drug2R, data = df, var.equal = TRUE)
#p=0.01155<0.05, rejuectH0, which shows there is significant difference between the control group and drug2R group.

#According to the t-tests above, drug2L and drug2R(.6 mg of Left and Right isomers of Hyoscine) have significant effect on hours of sleep. However, it is noted that a small dataset may not be sufficient to represent the problems and could encounter some issues like outliers, missing values(no outliers or missing values in this dataset), overfitting, sampleling bias etc. But this dataset is a good sample to practice t-test.
